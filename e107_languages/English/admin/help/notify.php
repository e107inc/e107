site is being flooded.<br /><br />
You can also, as another example, set 'News item posted by admin' to user class 'Members' and all your users will be 
sent news items you post to the site in an email.<br /><br />
If you would like the email notifications to be sent to an alternative email address - select the 'Email' option and
